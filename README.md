## Directions for Updates

Each of the following should be completed through seperate pull requests.

### README.md Updates

For each page, use a triple pound sign to create a subsection with the title of the page being added. Then use standard paragraphs and lists as apporpriate to document where page information was gathered from (include formal citations), how/why information was included or excluded from the page, and details on the formatting and styling choices for the display of information. Creators/editors of the page and the documentaion should be listed at the end of the write-up using the @ character with GitHub usernames.

Once your subsection is written, edit the appropriate item in the list of included pages to be an anchor link to the new subsection. Note that subsection titles must be unique, simple, and descriptive.

Other styling options for the READEME documentation can be found here: [GitHub Docs: Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Individual Pages Updates

Each of the pages listed above should be researched via the faculty and students of the Math and CS Department, or from the Mount's [Course Catalog](https://catalog.msmary.edu/index.php). The page must use the CSS files included in the repository so that the style matches the welcome.html page. Filenames must follow camel notation.

### Welcome Page Updates

When new pages are added to the repository, the welcome.html page must be updated with a link to the new file.

## Page Documentations

### Welcome Page

The index.html page is the landing page for this departmental website. Information was gathered from the Mount's Course Catalog, the [School of Science, Mathematics & Technology](https://msmary.edu/academics/schools-divisions/school-of-science-mathematics-and-technology/index.html) webpage, and department faculty discussions. Also referenced is the [Visit Emmitsburg](https://visitemmitsburg.com) site.

### Cyber Defense Club:

**Information Included:**

* Purpose of activity
* Oversight of organization
* Target participant audience
* Instructions to join
* Event activities
* Notable facts
* Additional information
* Official website / Instagram

**Documentation:**

Brady Mills was responsible for structuring the original HTML document, while Kaylib Sease, focused on integrating the CSS. The project began as a barebones with simple headers and paragraphs that included the information that was collected during the research period. It was further divided up into sections to enable to use of a navigation bar once implemented. The code for the buttons and navigation bars were added after the initial rough draft. 

The only information that was not included was the names of the officers, as we could not obtain proper written permission for their usage. Everything else was listed within the project requirements and was relevant to the organization of topic.

The information was gathered from the faculty member who helps to manage the organization and frequently participates in its event. Contact was made through email, and as an extension he collected information on our behalf from the collective members of the CDC. 

**Directions for Updates:**

Everything that is necessary should be included within the file. Each section is labeled with an ID to make for easy understanding. If it becomes necessary to update the image, or icon, be sure to have the path to the image file correct, or in the same folder. The "middleSmall" option within the repository's css was used as to not take up the whole screen. If the website needs to be updated with new information, please contact the current organization faculty advisor or student officers.

Version 1 of the website includes one stylesheet. Styles are defined and used on the welcome page for left and right side menus, header, main content area, citation caption, and scrolling top button. Other styles are defined for potential use on subpages for blog entries, calendar displays, two- and three-column sections, drop down menus, and special button menu items.
